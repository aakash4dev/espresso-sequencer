//! L1 Client
//!
//! [`L1Client`] defines the interface that Espresso Sequencer nodes use to interact with the L1.
//! Sequencer nodes must read from the L1 to populate Espresso block metadata such as the L1 chain
//! height, which is used to facilitate bridging between the L1 and any rollups which are running on
//! the sequencer.
//!
//! This client runs asynchronously, updating an in-memory snapshot of the relevant L1 information
//! each time a new L1 block is published. This design as a few advantages:
//! * The L1 client is not synchronized with or triggered by HotShot consensus. It can run in pace
//!   with the L1, which makes it easy to use a subscription instead of polling for new blocks,
//!   vastly reducing the number of L1 RPC calls we make.
//! * HotShot block building does not interact directly with the L1; it simply reads the latest
//!   snapshot from the client's memory. This means that block production is instant and infallible.
//!   Any failures or delays in interacting with the L1 will just slow the updating of the L1
//!   snapshot, which will cause the block builder to propose with a slightly old snapshot, but they
//!   will still be able to propose on time.
