# Espresso Sequencer

The Espresso Sequencer offers rollups credible neutrality and enhanced interoperability, without compromising on scale.
Consisting of a data availability solution and a decentralized network of nodes that sequences transactions, layer-2
rollups can leverage the Espresso Sequencer to give developers and end users fast confirmations, low (and fair) fees,
and robust infrastructure.

# Running the demo

Refer to [example-l2/README.md](example-l2/README.md) for instructions on how to run a dockerized Espresso Sequencer
network with an example Layer 2 rollup application.

# Development

- Obtain code: `git clone git@github.com:EspressoSystems/espresso-sequencer`.
- Make sure [nix](https://nixos.org/download.html) is installed.
- Activate the environment with `nix-shell`, or `nix develop`, or `direnv allow` if using [direnv](https://direnv.net/).

## Run the tests

    just pull # to pull docker images
    cargo test --all-features

## Building figures

    make doc

## Building and running

Docker images and the [docker-compose-demo.yaml](docker-compose-demo.yaml) file are provided for convenience. The
Docker-based demo fetches the images from the `ghcr` repository, where they are updated with every push to `main` on
GitHub. For testing uncommitted changes, you can also run the binaries by manually building and running the services.

Build all executables with `cargo build --release`. You may then start a sequencer network. First, start an
orchestrator. Choose a port `$PORT` to run it on and decide how many sequencer nodes `$N` you will use, then run
`target/release/orchestrator -p $PORT -n $N`.

The sequencer will distribute a HotShot configuration to all the nodes which connect to it, which specifies consensus
parameters like view timers. There is a default config, but you can override any parameters you want by passing
additional options to the `orchestrator` executable. Run `target/release/orchestrator --help` to see a list of available
options. Next, you must launch two `web-server` instances, which are necessary to facilitate consensus. One web server
is for data availability, while the other coordinates consensus among sequencer nodes. Pick a `$DA_PORT` and a
`$CONSENSUS_PORT` and run:

```bash
target/release/web-server -p $DA_PORT
target/release/web-server -p $CONSENSUS_PORT
```

Once you have started the orchestrator and the web servers, you must connect `$N` sequencer nodes to them, after which
the network will start up automatically. To start one node, run

```bash
target/release/sequencer \
    --orchestrator-url http://localhost:$PORT \
    --da-server-url http://localhost:$DA_PORT \
    --consensus-server-url http://localhost:$CONSENSUS_PORT \
    -- http --port 8083 -- query --storage-path storage -- submit
```

A useful Bash snippet for running `$N` nodes simultaneously in the background of your shell is:

```bash
for i in `seq $N`; do
    target/release/sequencer \
        --orchestrator-url http://localhost:$PORT \
        --da-server-url http://localhost:$DA_PORT \
        --consensus-server-url http://localhost:$CONSENSUS_PORT
done
```

Note: if the sequencer shows a `"Connection refused"` error you may need to use `127.0.0.1` instead of `localhost` when
connecting to the web server. This is because `localhost` may resolve to `::1` if dual stack (ipv4 and ipv6) networking
is enabled.

### Contracts

#### Development

A foundry project for the contracts specific to HotShot can be found in the directory `contracts`.

To compile

```shell
forge build
```

To run the tests

```shell
forge test
```

In order to avoid constant warnings about checksum mismatches with [svm-rs](https://github.com/roynalnaruto/svm-rs)
managed `solc` we set `FOUNDRY_SRC` to solc installed via flake.nix.

- To use the contrats from rust generate the rust contracts bindings: `just update-contract-bindings`.

To generate documentation in `./docs` for solidity code run

```shell
forge doc
```

#### Deployment

To deploy the contracts to a local testnet, first run a dev chain (e. g. `anvil`), then run

    forge script DeployHotShot --broadcast --rpc-url local

To deploy to sepolia set `SEPOLIA_RPC_URL` and `MNEMONIC` env vars and run

    forge script DeployHotShot --broadcast --rpc-url sepolia

To additionally verify the contact on etherscan set the `ETHERSCAN_API_KEY` env var and run

    forge script DeployHotShot --broadcast --rpc-url sepolia --verify

Running the script will save a file with details about the deployment in `contracts/broadcast/$CHAIN_ID`.

## Misc

### Authenticate with GitHub container registry

This is only necessary to fetch private images.

- Go to your github profile
- Developer Settings > Personal access tokens > Personal access tokens (classic)
- Generate a new token
  - for the scope options of the token, tick the _repo_ box.
- Run `docker login ghcr.io --username <you_github_id> --password <your_personal_access_token>`
