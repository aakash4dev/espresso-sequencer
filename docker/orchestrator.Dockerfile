# Set up view timing for optimal performance in high volume conditions. We set a fairly long minimum
# propose time to wait to build up a large block before proposing.
ENV ESPRESSO_ORCHESTRATOR_MIN_PROPOSE_TIME=10s
# We set the minimum block size to 1, limiting the number of empty blocks but allowing us to propose
# a block immediately after the minimum propose time, keeping latency low in low-volume cases.
ENV ESPRESSO_ORCHESTRATOR_MIN_TRANSACTIONS=1
# Since min transactions is 1, max propose time only controls the frequency of empty blocks. We set
# this not too much higher than min propose time, for reasonable latency in low volume conditions,
# when empty blocks are required to push non-empty blocks through the pipeline.
ENV ESPRESSO_ORCHESTRATOR_MAX_PROPOSE_TIME=30s
# The view timeout is larger, since it should only matter when something goes wrong (i.e. leader
# failure).
